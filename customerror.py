'''
A custom error (also called a user-defined exception) is an error type you create yourself when the built-in exceptions donâ€™t fully describe your specific problem.
You define it by creating a class that inherits from Exception (or another built-in exception) and then raising it when needed.

Why use custom errors?
Makes debugging easier with meaningful names.
Allows you to handle specific errors differently.
Keeps code clean instead of relying on generic ValueError or RuntimeError.

a = int(input("Enter value betwwen 1 to 5:"))
if (a>1  or a<5):
    raise ValueError("Value should be in between 1 to 5")
